# Mine Sweeper

### In the popular **Minesweeper** game you have a board with some mines and those cells that don't contain a mine have a number in it that indicates the total number of mines in the neighboring cells. Starting off with some arrangement of mines we want to create a **Minesweeper** game setup.

<br />

`Example`

For

<br />

```go
matrix = [[ true, false, false],
          [false,  true, false],
          [false, false, false]]
```

the output should be

```go
solution(matrix) = [[1, 2, 1],
                    [2, 1, 1],
                    [1, 1, 1]]
```
